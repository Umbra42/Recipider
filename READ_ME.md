hello. welcome to the read me file of this project

# Recipider

Video Demo:  (https://youtu.be/K62HFbG3iYk)

this application will prompt the user to select one of three recipe options or to re-roll the recipes given.
after having selected the recipe the app will provide a list of ingredients and the preperation steps. the information is going to be in dutch because i wanted to build something usefull for myself maybe in the future i will expand functionality but this is it for now.
the app crawls the web for recipes provided by local supermarket brands obeying robots.txt
originally i wanted to write 2 spiders but the second site didnt allow any scraping what so ever. but the code is still pressent and commented out
